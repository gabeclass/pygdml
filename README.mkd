# PyGDML

This is a library for writing GDML files in python, as well as converting them from Blender. It consists of two things; a python module (pygdml) and a blender add-on. The blender addon should be available as a zipped download; you can also make it from source by combining the contents of the `pygdml` directory and the `blender_scripts` directory; make sure you use the `__init__.py` file from the `blender_scripts` directory, not the one used in pygdml.

To install pygdml, run `pip install .` in the pygdml directory. Add a `-e` if you want changes in this directory (like `git pull`) to affect the installed version.

To install the Blender add-on, open Blender and go to `File -> User Preferences...` and go to the add-ons tab. The install button is near the bottom. You can directly install the .zip or .tar.gz file without extracting.
